# Hunter CS Winter 2019 CodeFest 
## Welcome to TubeText
We are Hunter College Students who came together to build this web application that allows the user
to be able to take notes while watching videos in real time, and time stamp them in order to 
be able to refer to them later on.

## To Test Locally
If you wish to manipulate or run this application locally please donwload the files.
First downlad all necessary packages by running the code below, it may take some time to install
```
npm install
cd server
npm install
cd ../client
npm install
```
then to run the application you need to open two terminals in the first terminal be sure to be in 
the root directory and run:
```
npm start
```
Then do the same command but in the client side as well:
```
cd client
npm start
```
With this you should have the web app running on localhost:3000
