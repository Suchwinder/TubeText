# Hunter CS Winter 2019 CodeFest 
## Welcome to TubeText
We are Hunter College Students who came together to build this web application that allows the user
to be able to take notes while watching videos in real time, and time stamp them in order to 
be able to refer to them later on.

# Getting Started
- run  `npm run client-install` to install all dependencies for front-end
- run  `npm run server-install` to install all dependencies for back-end

# Contributing to DEVELOPMENT
- To simultaneously run backend and front end, execute this script in your terminal: `npm run dev`    
## Front-End only 
- run `npm run client` in your terminal to start the React server without the backend
## Back-End only 
- run `npm run server` in your terminal to only start up the server without the front-end React server launching

With this you should have the web app running on localhost:3000
